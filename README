Readme for APC 524 HW3 
Author: Jeff Lestz
Last Modified: 29 November 2016 

This directory contains the following 4 files

newton.py: Newton class which contains methods to find zeros using Newton's method 

testNewton.py: unit tests to ensure that Newton solver works as expected 

functions.py: functions to calculate numerical Jacobian and construct polynomials

testFunction.py: unit tests to ensure that the functions in functions.py return what they promise

To add: explanation of how to run each code  

Left TO DO: 
1. Improve Readme to give instructions on how to run code, special cases, etc 
2. Improve Readme to enumerate which tests demonstrate features required in the hw specs
3. ExpSin jacobian test failing analytic vs numerical due to some strange horz vs vert vector values... 
4. add testExpSinAnalvsNum solutions in testNewton
5. Add tests to show that zeros are found for these complex functions
6. Verify no missing tests from the specs

Instructions: ExpSin must take in a list, not a matrix(?)
